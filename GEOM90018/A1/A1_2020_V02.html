<h2>GEOM90018 Spatial Databases - A1: Geomatrical queries</h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>By the end of this practical you should be able to: </p>

<ol>

  <li>understand  spatial data types; <br>

  </li>

  <li>retrieve information about objects based on their spatial
properties; and</li>

  <li>create new spatial data.</li>

</ol>

This practical should require <span style="font-style: italic;">two
weeks</span> to complete. <br>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This practical will introduce you to the basics of spatial analysis in SQL. We will use the spatial capabilities of PostGIS DBMS to perform basic spatial operations on the sample data from the US Census Bureau, the Digital Chart of the World, and some data created by yourself. In addition to pgAdmin, we encourage you to try other clients, such as HeidiSQL, an open-source DB SQL client, so you can get to try out different options.</p>

<h3>Exercise P1.1: Viewing spatial data</h3>

<p>A spatial DBMS like PostGIS has no spatial data viewing capabilities. Indeed, one of the reasons why spatial DBMS are such powerful systems is that, unlike GIS software packages, a spatial DBMS treats the storage, querying, and management of spatial data as completely separate functions from viewing that data. However, when learning about any spatial database it is often helpful to be able to display the data you are using graphically. There are many different ways that you can view data in a spatial database, including linking it to GIS software packages like QGIS (an open-source desktop GIS) or ArcGIS.
</p>
<ol>
<p>
1. Start QGIS, available from the menu on most lab computers, or downloadable from http://www.qgis.org/ for most common platforms. Note that MAC users need to install a separate GDAL (complete) package - available as a simple installer. Check IE Department folder if QGIS is not available on the general menu on the Lab computers.<br>
2.	Connect to the database: To view any spatial data,&nbsp;QGIS&nbsp;first requires information about the connection to a spatial DBMS server. Under the Layer menu, select "Add PostGIS layer". Clicking on the "New" button in the Connections menu allows you to create a new connection, using the information settings you used in the previous practical. <br>
    - The name can be anything you want (e.g., myconnection). <br>
    - The host is: 172.26.88.92<br>
    - The port is: 5432<br>
    - The database is: geom90018<br>
    - The username is: your LMS username <br>
    - The password is: your LMS password </p>
<p> 3.	Select data to view: The available tables should appear in the drop-down menu. You will currently only see tables from the schema "spatial". It is not your own schema, and you can only read those data. </p>
  <p> 4.	Explore the data: Panning, zooming, changing the representation, and even some analysis functions are all available in QGIS. Have a look around the software and familiarize yourself with its GIS and database functions. I suggest you start by exploring tables containing US data from the Digital Chart of the World dataset, such as "us_cities","us_counties" and "us_restaurants"</p>
  <p>Remember, QGIS is always there for you to allow you to graphically view, explore, and perform simple queries on data if you wish so. </p>
  <br>

</ol><h3>Exercise P1.2: Overview of spatial objects </h3>

This exercise will shows you how to get overview information about
a&nbsp;database's spatial data contents. You will retrieve information about the basic spatial properties of objects described by the database. The focus is on the
geometry processing functions of the spatial database. We will use the US
data from the Digital Chart of the World dataset.

<ol>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Login to the
course database server</span>.
Log in to the server using the technique covered in the last
practical.</li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get an
    overview of the
    available data</span>: List all the data attributed to the owner
  "spatial" (this was covered in the last practical). Verify if
    the&nbsp;following tables are present: world_continents,
    world_countries, us_cities, us_interstates, us_parks, us_rivers,
    us_states, us_restaurants.&nbsp;</li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Attributes
of the table containing spatial data</span>: Investigate the names of the columns containing attributes of the spatial data type for
each of the tables listed above. Provide the answer in the form of a
SELECT
statement.
<br> HINT1: The geometry columns in PostGIS are listed as type USER-DEFINED in the table "information_schema.tables".<br> HINT2: the table "geometry_columns" is a little more informative about the geometric data types in columns. </li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Information
about spatial
coordinates</span>: We will find out some
basic&nbsp;information about the coordinate systems used to store
spatial objects. We will use
the state of New York (us_states.state_abrv='NY') and other US states.</li>

  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Find out
the type of the spatial object</span>: One of the most important
pieces of information we need about a specific spatial object is what type of
object it is (point, line, polygon, ...). Find out what is the spatial
data typs of the state of New York. Use the
following query template, based on the PostGIS function "GeometryType":
      <div class="example">SELECT GeometryType(geom) FROM spatial.us_states;</div>

Note the output of the geometry type. What is the relationship between the geometry type in the query above and that found previously in the "geometry_columns" table? Investigate this relationship more carefully by looking at other tables in the spatial schema. </li>

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Find out
the spatial reference system in which the geometry is defined</span>:
The SRID is a code specifying in what coordinate system the
spatial&nbsp;objects are stored. Find out what coordinate system
Georgia's coordinates are stored in. What does this code mean? <br>

      <div class="example">SELECT ST_SRID(geom) FROM spatial.us_states WHERE ...;</div>
    </li>

  </ol>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Information
about spatial
properties</span>: In addition to coordinates, we can find out a
variety of spatial information for our spatial data. <br>

    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>

  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compute
area</span>s: Find
the area of the US state of
NY. HINT: to work with the geometries in PostGIS, you have to provide a
spatial function and its parameter as arguments of the SELECT
statement. The usual template is: <big><code>ST_FUNCTION
(parameter1,parameter2,...)</code></big>. The basic area function
looks like this: <br>

      <div class="example">SELECT ST_Area(geometry_column) FROM ...</div>

Look up on the web the documentation for <big><code>ST_Area</code></big>. Note that the function accepts a second argument, "use_spheroid". Investigate what this argument does, and what difference it makes to the answer. What are the units of your answer? Once you've got the area of New York, write a query
to list the names of all US states, in descending order of area
(largest first). What is the fourth largest state?<br>

    </li>

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compute
perimeter and lengths</span>:
Two related functions return the length for lines or the perimeter for
polygons. The functions are <big><code>ST_Length(geometry_column)</code></big> and <big><code>ST_Perimeter(geometry_column)</code></big> (both with options "use_spheroid" parameters). Find out the perimeter of
the state of
New York. Again, take care to understand the number produced. What are its units? What do they mean? Adapt your query to provide the answer in
meters and miles (in one query). Now write a query to list the names of
all US states, in descending order of perimeter (longest first). What
is the state with the fourth longest perimeter?&nbsp;<br>

    </li>

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Determine
the bounding box of a spatial object</span>: Bounding boxes are
an important concept in spatial data handling. They provide the extent
of the object along the ordinates of the coordinate system
(northernmost point of a continent, and so on...). The functions
<big><code>ST_XMax(geometry)</code></big>, <big><code>ST_XMin(geometry)</code></big>, <big><code>ST_YMax(geometry)</code></big>, and<big><code> ST_YMin(geometry) </code></big>return the coordinates of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a
geometry. The function
<big><code>ST_Envelope(geometry)</code></big> also provides the MBR as a geometry itself. Find the MBR of New York. Then retrieve the north-south extent of NY. Write a (single) SQL statement
to give the minimum and maximum latitude for each state. Label the
columns in your statement NAME, MAXLAT, and MINLAT. HINT:
Assign aliases to the outputs of the SELECT statement
      <div class="example">SELECT (Function1
(parameters...)) AS alias1, (Function2
(parameters...)) AS alias2 from ...</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P1.3: Spatial data storage </h3>

In this exercise, you will define and create your own table with sample
spatial data. At the end
of the lab,
don't forget to remove the metadata entries, drop the table and
indexes. <br>
<ol>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Inserting
    spatial data</span>: Create a table "petrolstation" with spatial
    data in a column called "location". You will
    create a table containing the coordinates of three "petrol stations",
    with the following coordinates:<br>

    <table style="text-align: left; height: 204px; width: 407px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

      <tbody>

        <tr>

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="2">Name</td>

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="2">ID</td>

          <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Point Geometry</td>

          </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Lon</td>

          <td>Lat</td>

          </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Agip</td>

          <td>1</td>

          <td>-77.01669</td>

          <td>33.90124</td>

          </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Shell</td>

          <td>2</td>

          <td>-77.017</td>

          <td>33.90120</td>

          </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Texaco</td>

          <td>3</td>

          <td>-77.018</td>

          <td>33.9013</td>

          </tr>

        </tbody>
      </table>

    HINT: Use the following template:<br>

    <div class="example">CREATE TABLE petrolstation(name VARCHAR(8), id&nbsp;INTEGER);<br>
      <br>
SELECT addGeometryColumn('yourschema','petrolstation','location',4326,'POINT',2);  <br>

      <br>

      INSERT INTO petrolstation VALUES (...., ST_GeomFromText('POINT(x1 x2)',4326));</div>

</li>

Note that the function <big><code>POINT</code></big> is a WKT ("well-known text") function. WKT is a geometry language used to describe shapes. The function <big><code>ST_GeomFromText</code></big> is a PostGIS function. You can use the WKT function format as the input to the PostGIS function. There also exist direct PostGIS functions that do the same job, but without WKT. For example, investigate achieving the other entries using the <big><code>ST_MakePoint</code></big> function. Verify the creation of the table by selecting its records. If you like,
    you should also be able to view your new spatial data using QGIS. <br>

</ol>

<h3>Exercise P1.4: Simple geometric analysis</h3>

In this section we perform some simple geometric analyses. In the next practical we shall perform some more complex
analyses.<br>

<ol>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Querying
distances</span>:
The
distance between any geometry (point, line, or polygon) and a point can
be determined using the function<big><code> ST_Distance</code></big>. Note that in the case of distance between a line
or polygon and a point the procedure retrieves the <span style="font-style: italic;">minimum </span>distance. For example, try the following query which
will provide the distance in metres between two of the petrol stations.
What are the distances between all pairs of the petrol stations?<br>

    <div class="example">SELECT ST_Distance(a.location, b.location,true) FROM petrolstation a, petrolstation b WHERE a.name='Agip' and b.name='Texaco';</div>

    <div class="example">SELECT a.name, b.name, ST_Distance(a.location, b.location,true) FROM petrolstation a, petrolstation b;</div>

  </li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced
distance</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Select
the names of the 10
closest
restaurants from the restaurant poi_id=33625120 (us_restaurants table).
The general template
for the distance clause is as for that above:
    <div class="example">SELECT
ST_Distance(query_objects, origin_object) FROM ...;</div>

However, you will need to use a nested statement and the operator
LIMIT from Practical 1 to answer this question. Assign an alias
'DISTANCE' to the function <big><code>ST_Distance</code></big> and order by distance for the first subquery.</li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Within
distance</span>: We
can
also find places that are within a certain distance of each other
(assuming an index has been created) using the <big><code>ST_DWithin</code></big> function. Try the following query, inserting a range of sensible values
in place of the distance "x": <br>

    <div class="example">SELECT * FROM petrolstation a,
petrolstation
b
WHERE ST_DWithin(a.location, b.location, distance)='TRUE'; </div>

  </li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Buffering</span>:
A buffer
creates a new geometry containing all the locations within a specified
distance of a input geometry. Create buffers of 1 mile around each of
the petrol stations, using the following template:<br>

    <div class="example">SELECT
ST_Buffer(geometry,
distance) FROM ... </div>

  </li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Centroid</span>:
We can
create
the centroid (center of gravity) for a polygonal shape using the
following template:
    <div class="example">SELECT
ST_Centroid(geometry) ... </div>

Use this template to find the centroid of the buffer of 1000m for
the Shell petrol station. What do you notice about this centroid and
    why? <br>
  </li>

</ol>

<h3>Assessment A1: Spatial SQL</h3>

<h4>Preliminaries</h4>

<ol>

  <li>This assignment is worth 8% of your final class mark.</li>

  <li>The due date for the assignment is clearly stated on the course
web
site, accessible via the LMS. <br>

  </li>

  <li>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. It is your
responsibility
to ensure you are aware of the assignment due date posted on the course
web site. </li>

</ol>

<h4>Submission</h4>
Your task is to answer the 8 questions in the
"assignment" section below. You must submit one plain text file
(named &lt;<span class="SpellE">studentno</span>&gt;.txt or .sql, where &lt;<span class="SpellE">studentno</span>&gt; is your student number). The text file must
contain exactly 8 (or less) executable statements, one single statement per question, in the correct order. Each line should contain only one SQL query.
You must leave a comment (e.g., "-- No answer for Q3") in place of
any questions you do not answer. We will accept SQL code formatted over multiple lines, as long as you respect the ";" convention to end the statement. You must submit your file online using the course web site (accessible via the LMS at http://www.lms.unimelb.edu.au). No
other submission method is acceptable.
<br>

<h4>Marking</h4>

<ul>

  <li>Your submission will be marked out of <span style="font-weight: bold;">8</span>, with up to one
mark awarded per
question. <br>

  </li>

  <li>A perfect answer will be awarded <span style="font-weight: bold;">1
mark</span>. A near-perfect answer (almost exactly right, but
perhaps
with some slight mistake or missing step) may be awarded <span style="font-weight: bold;">half a mark</span>.
Anything else will be
awarded <span style="font-weight: bold;">0 marks</span>.
    <br>

  </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marks</span>
will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">deducted</span>
for any incorrect
submissions (e.g., using a Word or HTML document instead of a plain
text file; files that contain other than 8 answers (well formed SQL statements) and potential well formed SQL comments ( one per line); answers not in the correct order; answers that contain non-SQL
parts, such as question numbers; or SQL queries lacking correct termination with a semicolon, ";").<br>

  </li>

  <li>It is not possible to get negative marks (e.g., an
assignment
score of 1 out of 8 with 2 marks deducted for incorrect submission
will be a final mark of 0, not -1).</li>

</ul>

<h4>Assignment A1</h4>


The questions you must answer for this assignment all concern the
sample data from the US Census Bureau and US
data from the Digital Chart of the World dataset. Your assignment is to
provide SQL statements to
answer the following 8 questions (see "Submission" section above
for more details). <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</span> Beware of the difference between geometries and geographies (data types). You need to think of how different units relate to the measurement of e.g., distances and areas, and deal with this in your queries.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint 2:</span> Only output the attributes you are asked for<br>
