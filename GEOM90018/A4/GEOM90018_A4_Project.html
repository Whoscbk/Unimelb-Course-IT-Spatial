<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Where previous practicals have asked you to find the solution to well-specified problems, this practical asks you to design a solution to investigate more open-ended problems - as a data analyst. You will use as the focus for your investigation the table "checkins", possibly n conjunction with any other data in the "spatial" schema. The table contains the time (date, time), location (geom), user id (uid), location id (poi) of approximately 6M checkins made by Gowalla (social network) users between Feb 2009 and Oct 2010. The table "friends" also contains the friend associations between Gowalla users identified in the check-ins.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">
For this assignment, you may also use the newly imported OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset of Melbourne region, downloaded from <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/Melbourne/"> bbbike.org</a> on 1 May 2019. The data was imported into the geom90018 PostgreSQL database using the <a href="https://www.volkerschatz.com/net/osm/osm2pgsql-usage.html">osm2pgsql</a> tool. The data is stored into 7 tables whose names start with "melbourne_osm_" (melbourne_osm_nodes, melbourne_osm_point, melbourne_osm_polygon, melbourne_osm_rels, melbourne_osm_roads, melbourne_osm_ways), all of which are located in schema "spatial". It is advisable that you read about the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements">OSM elements</a> in order to understand how OSM models real world objects with nodes, ways, and polygons, and how it uses tags to record their attributes. Since tags are in fact key-value pairs, they cannot be represented with the data types we have previously used in postgresql (e.g. integer, varchar, or geometry). Instead, they can be stored into <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/hstore.html">hstore</a> data type, which is available as an extension to the PostgreSQL database. Hstore allows users to store multiple key-value pairs into a single column, and do some operations on them (examples of some operations are shown below, and you can see the whole list in the hstore documentation website). When working with these tables keep in mind the following things:
<ul class="ul/iden1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Nodes, ways, and rels tables are the direct representation of what is stored in the OSM databases. These tables are stored in our database without hstore columns for tags, and without geometry columns. You may still use these tables in your analysis if you want to.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Point, line, polygon, and roads tables are abstracted from data in the nodes, ways and rels tables by the osm2pgsql tool (there has been some processing done on these tables in order to adapt them to and make them usable in a PostgreSQL database). These tables are stored in our database with hstore "tags" columns, and geometry "way" columns. Also keep in mind that these geometries are stored in the WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator (EPSG:3857).</span></li>
</ul>

Here are some examples of how you can get familiar with the new OSM data:

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your task is to perform some analysis of this data set: to pose - and answer - some question of your choosing or reveal some interesting patterns in the data. Examples of possible analyses might include (but are not limited to):&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="ul/iden1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Identifying interesting spatial clusters of check-ins, such as the pattern of "footprints" of check-ins for each user, for a given region;</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Examining the relationship between the friend network and the spatial location of check ins, such as answering the question of whether friend network distance and spatial distance between check-ins are correlated; or</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Looking for spatiotemporal trends in the patterns of check-ins, such as identifying whether certain locations or points of interest are tending to increase or decrease in popularity over time.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You are strongly encouraged to develop your own analyses however, and not rely on these indicative suggestions. You can support your motivation by literature or current events (such as COVID-19) and then, reference these properly.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Your submission will be marked out of <b>16</b>. <br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Marks</b> will be <b>deducted</b> for any incorrect submissions (e.g., using a Word or HTML document instead of a plain text SQL file or PDF summary; SQL scripts that contain non-SQL parts, or fail to execute directly when marked, or require adaptation or editing to run).&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Marks will be allocated in four areas:</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Presentation (up to 3 marks): reflecting the clarity and care of presentation of the submission (of both the SQL script and the PDF submission, and taking care of good practices in data (geo)visualization).&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Technical correctness (up to 3 marks): reflecting the technical correctness of your SQL script and the design of your analysis procedure. &nbsp;</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Technical challenge (up to 5 marks): reflecting the level of technical challenge of the analysis, for example that combine geometric, topological, thematic, and even network operations.&nbsp; Creativity in your tools’ selection is highly encouraged, as is ’thinking outside the box’. In other words, if you acquired appropriate skills from other subjects, you can incorporate them in your work, but the emphasis still needs to be on the operations learned in this subject. You are encouraged to explore functions of PostGis we have not explored, including advanced ones (i.e., Raster data handling, etc)</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Originality and significance (up to 5 marks): reflecting the care and attention that has gone into developing an interesting and novel question to answer, problem to solve, or pattern to reveal.</span></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Some other points to note:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You may have more than one SQL statement in your script (e.g., you may have multiple SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or CREATE statements, if perhaps your script creates new tables which later parts of your analysis use). However, your SQL script must execute as a single process without any interaction or editing by the marker. &nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You may also include other data, in addition to the check-ins and friend network data, in your analysis, on condition it is either already in the class database (e.g., US states data sets) or you include additional data as part of your SQL script (i.e., using CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO statements). If you include additional data or create new tables, you must also include in your script statements to DROP any tables created at the end of the script (if necessary, commented out so the marker can still easily remove new tables after marking your script).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You are not required to use the entire check-ins/friend network (indeed, you may prefer not to use all 6M records). It is only required that you use the checkin data set to discover something new or answer an important problem.&nbsp;The "checkins_small" table has been created with a subset of 100,000 records from the "checkins" table, in case you wish to try out ideas on a smaller table. Your entire script must execute in a reasonable amount of time (i.e., less than 2-3 minutes).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You need to include comments in your SQL script (correctly formatted, preceded by the "--" comment ). Good quality comments increase the clarity of your script and will improve your marks in the "Presentation" category.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If you are stuck in thinking of a good analysis, spend a little time just looking at (some of) the data (perhaps in QGIS). What sorts of patterns suggest themselves? You might also approach the assignment from the opposite direction by thinking first about the technical challenge (the most important marking criterion): what combinations of geometric, topological, thematic and network operations (and potentially others) could you imagine might lead to interesting results.</span></li>
